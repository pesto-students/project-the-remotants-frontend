## Stack
 ### Front-End:

  1. **React:** A JavaScript library that is used for building user interfaces.

  2. **React-Router:** This is used to handle the client-side routing in the app.

  3. **Redux:** It is used for managing state of the React app.

  4. **Redux-Thunk:** It is used to handle asynchronous actions in Redux.

  5. **Apollo Client:** It is a fully featured GraphQL client that makes it easy to fetch data with GraphQL.

 ### Testing:

  1. **Jest:** It is a testing framework that comes preloaded with tools like task runner, assertion library, to execute different unit test cases.

  2. **Enzyme:** It is basically used to create a simpler user interface for writing unit tests. As it doesn't have a test runner, thus it uses Jest to execute the tests.
